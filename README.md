#### Description:
This project is a fully responsive, professional website for Mahnoor Saeed Khan Psychology Clinic, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The purpose of this website is to provide an online platform for the clinic where users can learn about services, contact the clinic, and book appointments efficiently. The website was developed as my CS50x final project, applying concepts learned throughout the course, including front-end development, responsive design, and interactive functionality.

The website is designed to be intuitive and visually appealing, reflecting the professionalism and credibility of a psychology clinic. Users visiting the site can easily navigate through different sections to access relevant information and interact with the appointment booking system. This project demonstrates my ability to create functional, user-friendly web applications from scratch using only client-side technologies.
